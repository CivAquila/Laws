#### Section II: Punishment

All Crimes, including crimes not defined in this document, shall be rated on a level of one to four points. Each level shall have minimum and maximum sentences, as well as reparations for property damaged, stolen, or otherwise affected. If the victim and perpetrator of any crime agree on a private settlement, The City of Aquila shall insure that all conditions of the settlement are met, and not hold a trial if so. This does not include crimes against the City of Aquila.

If at any time one’s total points are more than seven, then the maximum sentence for every crime they commit after seven points is doubled. If seven points are accumulated within a matter of 24 hours or the criminal has multiple existing offenses in other nations, the criminal may be held in private custody until such time that, under reputable arbitration or agreement from both defending and offending parties, an agreement is made and all matters are settled outside of court. The burden of proof of the criminal exceeding the seven point mark within 24 hours falls on the private party intending to hold the offender. Should that party fail to prove to a city justice that the threshold was met, the pearl must be relinquished to the City of Aquila. In extenuating circumstances, it is permissible for a judge to allow private custody of pearls that do not meet the 24 hour-seven point mark if the security of the pearl is at risk. 

##### Types of Punishment

###### Pearling:

The criminal shall be pearled and the pearl shall be placed in a vault or chest as deemed appropriate by the judge.

###### Reparations:

The criminal shall pay a fine in either pearls, diamonds, iron, obsidian, a combination thereof, or other items dictated by the judge. How they pay the fee is at the discretion of the judge. They may or may not be pearled while they collect reparations, at discretion of the Judge. If a criminal refuses to collect reparations, they shall remain pearled until reparations have been paid.


##### Levels of Punishment

Each crime level will have a set of maximum punishments that can be applied to a guilty player. The judge may apply a lower level crime punishment to a higher level crime if deemed necessary. 

###### Level 1 Crimes:

Possible Sentences: Reparations equivalent to twice the damage dealt, temporary banishment from Aquila and all land territories of Aquila and/or 24-72 hours pearled.

###### Level 2 Crimes:

Possible Sentences: Reparations equivalent to twice the damage dealt, temporary banishment from Aquila and all land territories of Aquila and/or 3-30 days pearled.

Possible Sentences: Reparations equivalent to four times the damage dealt, permanent banishment from Aquila and all land territories of Aquila and indefinite pearling.

#### Section III: Criminal Property

##### Peaceful Pearling

Anyone who is accused of a crime and peacefully turns themselves in is considered peacefully pearled. If the accused player is found guilty and has property or possessions, including their inventory, within Aquila or its land territories, it is up to the judge to decide if the guilty player shall keep their property/possessions or if the government shall reclaim it. The government will first attempt to return any stolen goods back to the players who reported thefts before storing or distributing reclaimed items. Players must report stolen items by the guilty player with snitch logs before or within 2 days after the capture of the guilty player.

##### Non-Peaceful Pearling

Anyone who is accused of a crime and attempts to run, logout for an extended period of time or attack other players is considered non-peacefully pearled. If the accused player is found guilty and has property within Aquila or its land territories, the judge will determine if the property should be reclaimed by the government. If the guilty player has possessions within Aquila or its land territories, the judge will decide if the possessions are to be turned over to the government or given to the players involved in the capture of the guilty player. The government will first attempt to return any stolen goods back to the players who reported thefts before storing or distributing reclaimed items. Players must report stolen items by the guilty player with snitch logs before or within 2 days after the capture of the guilty player.
