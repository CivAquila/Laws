#####Harassment (2):

Harassment shall be defined as behavior or speech intended to disturb or upset, and it is characteristically repetitive. In the legal sense, it is intentional behavior which is found threatening or disturbing.

In Civcraft terms, harassment will be seen as acts including but not limited to: placing blocks to inhibit the movement of the affected party, excessive and repetitive waving of a weapon in the direct vicinity of the affected party, and excessive and intentional following of an affected party. All forms of harassment will only be found unlawful once the affected party has clearly asked more than once for the accused to desist.

No person shall be convicted of an offence under this article if the actions take place outside of Civcraft.

#####Inciting Hate (3)

Inciting Hate shall be defined as communicating statements in any public place, and not in private conversation, and inciting hatred against any identifiable group.

In this, “identifiable group” means any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, ethnic origin, gender or sexual orientation.

No person shall be convicted of an offence under this

(a) if he establishes that the statements communicated were true;

(b) if on reasonable grounds he believed the statements to be true;

(c) if, in good faith, he expressed an opinion on a religious subject;

(d) if, in good faith, his statements pertain to a group within Civcraft; or

(e) if, in good faith, he intended to point out, for the purpose of removal, matters producing or tending to produce feelings of hatred toward an identifiable group.

#####Uttering Threats (2)

Uttering Threats shall be defined as communicating intent to inflict harm or loss on another person.

In determining whether or not an accused is guilty of uttering threats the judge must establish

(a) that the accused conveyed a threat to cause death, pearling or harm to a person; or

(b) that the accused conveyed a threat to burn, destroy or damage property.

In determining whether or not an accused is guilty of uttering threats the judge must consider the context of the words which were spoken or written. The meaning attributed to the words should be that which a reasonable person would give them.

No person shall be convicted of an offence under this article

(a) if the words uttered were not meant to be taken seriously as a threat;

(b) if the words uttered were pertaining to a fair repercussion; or

(c) if the words uttered had a plausible alternative meaning which would cause them to not constitute a threat.

#####Prison Breaking (4)

Prison Breaking shall be defined as an attempt to break any vault/chest in Aquila with intent to release prisoners held inside.

####Section II: Punishment

All Crimes, including crimes not defined in this document, shall be rated on a level of one to four points. Each level shall have minimum and maximum sentences, as well as reparations for property damaged, stolen, or otherwise affected. If the victim and perpetrator of any crime agree on a private settlement, The City of Aquila shall insure that all conditions of the settlement are met, and not hold a trial if so. This does not include crimes against the City of Aquila.

If at any time one’s total points are more than seven, then the maximum sentence for every crime they commit after seven points is doubled. If seven points are accumulated within a matter of 24 hours or the criminal has multiple existing offenses in other nations, the criminal may be held in private custody until such time that, under reputable arbitration or agreement from both defending and offending parties, an agreement is made and all matters are settled outside of court. The burden of proof of the criminal exceeding the seven point mark within 24 hours falls on the private party intending to hold the offender. Should that party fail to prove to a city justice that the threshold was met, the pearl must be relinquished to the City of Aquila. In extenuating circumstances, it is permissible for a judge to allow private custody of pearls that do not meet the 24 hour-seven point mark if the security of the pearl is at risk. 

#####Types of Punishment

######Pearling:

The criminal shall be pearled and the pearl shall be placed in a vault deemed appropriate by the judge.

######Reparations:

The criminal shall pay a fine in either pearls, diamonds, iron, obsidian, a combination thereof, or other items dictated by the judge. How they pay the fee is at the discretion of the judge. They may or may not be pearled while they collect reparations, at discretion of the Judge. If a criminal refuses to collect reparations, they shall remain pearled until reparations have been paid.



#####Levels of Punishment

######Level 1 Crimes:

Maximum Sentence: Reparations equivalent to twice the damage dealt and 24 hours in the end.

######Level 2 Crimes:

Maximum Sentence: Reparations equivalent to the damage dealt and 30 days in the end.

######Level 3 and 4 Crimes:

Maximum Sentence: Reparations equivalent to twice the damage dealt and indefinite pearling.
